# projet_CY_Antibio_Tech

The CY-Antibio-Tech project allows to analyze data from experiments on mice. It generates graphs to visualize:
- The evolution of live bacteria in fecal samples according to treatments (placebo or antibiotics).
- The distribution of live bacteria in cecal and ileal samples.


Instructions to run the project:
Open the project from GitHub, put the input CSV file in the input/ folder and run the Python script.


Expected Results:
Line graph
Violin graphs

Limitations:
If there is no data for a sample type (cecal or ileal), graphs will not be generated.
